```{r cars}

  #            size = 4,
  #            label = c("flipbookr", "ggxmean", "ggsample", "ggstamp",
  #                      "doublecrochet",
  #                      "codeexplode", "exampleexploder", "ggmemory")) +

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
